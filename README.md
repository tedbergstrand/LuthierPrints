[Click Here for the Files](3D-Print-Files)

Welcome to LuthierPrints! This repository houses a collection of my 3D printable files tailored specifically for Luthiers and Guitar Repair Professionals. These files are meant to help you to print your own tools for guitar repair. All of these models are my designs. Feel free to modify them any way you like, but you **MUST** adhere to the GPL-3 License if you release them (or modifications of them). 

None of these are meant to be pretty. They were all things I needed at one point and hacked together in the quickest way I could. Feel free to re-design anything you like to fit your needs.

## Viewing the Models

To preview the 3D models directly within GitHub, just click on the STL file located in the respective folder (3D-Print-Files -> Print-Name). Everything is organized into folders.

## Printing the Models

I've included STL files for everything. You may need to flip the orientation on a few of them. I try my best to design models that don't require supports. So if you think you need support, make sure you can't flip it to a different orientation. I'll go through and flip things appropriately at some point. At this stage, I'm still trying to get everything together.

Remember that important curves always need to be printed horizontally to avoid a stair-stepping pattern (on the XY plane). 

Some things were meant to be printed in TPU. Some in harder plastics. Think about your application and decide accordingly.

## Fusion 360 Files

For some models, I have included Fusion 360 files, which can be used with Autodesk's Fusion 360 software. Feel free to customize and adapt these models to meet your needs. Remember, you **MUST** adhere to GPL-3 if you release a modified file.

## Missing Models
I can't find some of my models. But as I find or recreate them, I'll add them to this repo.
