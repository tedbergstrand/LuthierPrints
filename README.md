# LuthierPrints

Welcome to LuthierPrints! This repository houses a comprehensive collection of 3D printable files tailored specifically for Luthiers and Guitar Repair Professionals. These files are meant to help you to print your own tools for guitar repair. All of these models are my designs. Feel free to modify them any way you like, but you **MUST** adhere to the GPL-3 License if you release them (or modifications of them).

## Viewing the Models

To conveniently preview the 3D models directly within GitHub, simply click on the STL file located in this repository. Everything is organized into folders.

## Fusion 360 Files

For most models, I have included Fusion 360 files, which can be accessed and modified using Autodesk Fusion 360 software. Feel free to customize and adapt these models to meet your specific requirements.

## Missing Models
I can't find some of my models. But as I find or recreate them, I'll add them to this repo.
