My attachment is designed for this Cyclone Dust Collector Remix by Endlesscnc ()https://www.thingiverse.com/endlesscnc/). Endlesscnc's remix is based on an original design by FEMA( https://www.thingiverse.com/fema)

You'll need to print the model from Endlesscnc to plug the adapter into. Then it'll slot right on top of your Bynes sander. It takes one of the small shop vac hoses (~ 1 1/4").
